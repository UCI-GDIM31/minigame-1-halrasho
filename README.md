## Devlog
In this update, I created a custom platforming level in the Main scene by arranging platforms into a unique layout with jumps, vertical movement, and hazards. I duplicated the original Coin and MetalSpike GameObjects and placed at least five of each throughout the environment to add challenge and reward. I also adjusted the PlayerSpawn position to control where the player respawns and resized/moved the FallDeathZone to match the size of my level.
I finished by tweaking the player’s movement speed in the FirstPersonController component so the level feels smooth to play. After testing the scene multiple times, I finalized the level and prepared it for WebGL build and submission.
